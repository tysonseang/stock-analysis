# Analyzing Stock Data with VBA

## Overview of Project

This project involved the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language for Microsoft Office applications. VBA programming language is used to automate various tasks to create time efficiencies and reduce accidents and errors. For this work, VBA scripts were used with Microsoft Excel to read and write to cells and worksheets, make calculations, and use logic to perform analyses across multiple stocks from 2017 and 2018. VBA macros were created that trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells. Various foundational coding skills were used, including the use of for loops, nested for loops, and conditionals to direct logic flow, as well as syntax recollection, problem decomposition, debugging, and refactoring. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance DAQO New Energy Corp stock as well as various other green energy stocks, including those in the hydro, geothermal, wind, and bio space, in order to guide future investment opportunities. Following the creation of macros to automate the calculation, formatting, and analysis of stock data, the code was refactored to improve efficiency and reduce run times.  

## Results

Following the refactoring of the script, execution times were significantly trimmed as seen in the image below. Code now executes roughly 12x faster.

The formatted 2017 and 2018 analysis can at the file titled VBA_Challenege located [here](https://github.com/tysonseang/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm). Pre- and post-refactoring code is shown below to showcase the updates.

## Summary
Refactoring code can boost system performance and reduce the time needed to execute large VBA macros. This becomes increasingly important with larger datasets and datasets that are constantly updating. Due to the additional investments of time and work required to refactor code, it is important to weigh the pros and cons. For this project, refactored code ran roughly 12x faster than the original VBA script. This could prove beneficial if the code were used on larger datasets. However, refactoring was a time-intensive process, which was further impacted by my lack of significant experience writing VBA scripts.
